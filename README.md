If you want to check the source code out clone the repo.

But in short you can just clik the green button on top and download a .zip file, after decrompressing it, inside you will find a home.html, double click it and it should open in your browser.
\
Also you can check the fully functional live version here [NeoTennis](https://ad9311.github.io/neotennis/). If you click it you'll be taken to the home page.

If you would like to edit the files and especially the css file, you will need to use Sass to edit it. It is very simple, go ahead and [Install Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install) and use your command line tool to compile it. More instructions here [Sass Guide](https://sass-lang.com/guide).
